PROBLEM: you won't see in-memory database created tables in third-party tool  (dbeaver, IDEA)
Only in h2-console

1.
-- use in-memory database for spring boot application
jdbc:h2:mem:testdb

2.
-- script for dump from in-memory database
SCRIPT SIMPLE TO 'dump.sql';

3.
fixed script 'cargodb.sql' is saved in projed

4. launch spring boot application with file database:
jdbc:h2:file:./test_db
it will create database:
jdbc:h2:file:C:/Users/Me/DEV/GITHUB/ddd-spring-monolith-example/test_db

ATTENTION: 
4.1. when some tool is using file-database, then it is blocked for other tools 
(spring-boot vs dbeaver vs IDEA) !
4.2. Spring boot database initiation (schema.sql and jpa-auto-generation) doesn't work for file-database!

5. Stop application and use third-party tool for file-database initiation
(dbeaver, or Intellij IDEA Database View)

6. Now you can generate ER-diagram2
