PROBLEM 'COMMENT ON ..'

There is no way to add IF EXISTS for COMMENT ON TABLE/COLUMN
Because of it the scenario where lq-script is failed when it tries to add comment is possible!

For example: in lq-script we creates a table and after it we add comments on table and columns.
When there is no column with such name in db (the name is different, or column was removed)
